# crystal_ray_tracer

This is an example shard for use in generating ray-traced images.

It is a Reorganization of [jzakiya](https://forum.crystal-lang.org/u/jzakiya)'s ported-from-Ruby code into a Crystal-lang 'shard' library.

It is for sake of use in https://github.com/edin/raytracer under the `crystal` sub-folder; also for re-use elsewhere, as this is a shard.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     crystal_ray_tracer:
       github: your-github-user/crystal_ray_tracer
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "crystal_ray_tracer"
```

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Examples

### Build the example app

For a quick, simpler build to test this out, enter:
`crystal build examples/jzakiya.cr -o examples/jzakiya`

For a longer, more advanced build to get better performance, enter:
`crystal build examples/jzakiya.cr -o examples/jzakiya --release`

This doesn't (at least not yet) make much use of multi-threaded fibers, but you can enable it like this:
`crystal build examples/jzakiya.cr -o examples/jzakiya --release -Dpreview_mt`

The compiled file will be in the `examples` folder or what ever you specify after the `-o` option.

### Run the example app

`examples/jzakiya`

This will generate the example image (based on the image used for https://github.com/edin/raytracer) called `crystal-raytracer.png` in (for now) the root of the repo.

This file will look like:

![examples/crystal-raytracer.png](examples/crystal-raytracer.png "Image like what is generated by code in https://github.com/edin/raytracer")

(Using the `--release` flag makes it generate the image significantly faster than the un-optimized compilation. On my system including '--release', makes it run about 12 times faster.)
